      <div class="about-content-1">
        I am a <span>Year 11 student at MAGS</span> (<span>Mount Albert Grammar School</span>) with a strong interest in 
        <br>
        <span>Chemistry</span>, <span>Physics</span> and <span>Product Designing</span>. 
      </div>

      <div class="about-content-2">
        I enjoy studying <span>English</span>, <span>Math</span>, <span>Digital Technology</span>, <span>Physics</span>, <span>Chemistry</span>, and  <span>Product Design</span>. I’m 
        <br>
        passionate about learning skill, and I recently completed a course of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. Even this 
        <br>
        <span>webiste</span> is coded from my kmowledge of HTML and CSS which I learnt in <span>11DT2</span> class. I enjoy 
        <br>
        <span>designing products</span> and <span>making them</span>, recently I designed and made a <span>controller holder</span>. I’m always 
        <br>
        looking for ways to apply my knowledge to <span>real-world challenges</span>. In the future, I hope to pursue a
        <br>
        career in <span>engineering</span>.

        Outside of academics, you can find me <span>making content</span> on <span>YouTube</span>, <span>working out</span>, <span>playing video
        <br>
        games</span>, and <span>exploring new tech gadgets</span>.
